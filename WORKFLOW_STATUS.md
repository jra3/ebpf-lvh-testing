# Workflow Status Summary

## Current Workflows

### ✅ Working Workflows

1. **test-minimal.yml**
   - Simple BPF compilation test
   - No dependencies on VM images
   - Status: WORKING

2. **test-clean.yml** (NEW)
   - Tests BPF compilation and verification
   - Installs LVH but doesn't use VMs
   - Status: SHOULD WORK

3. **summary-test.yml** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive test of all components
   - Will show exactly what works and what doesn't
   - Status: SHOULD WORK

### ❌ Broken Workflows (with 404 errors)

1. **debug-lvh.yml**
   - Problem: Tries to download non-existent base.qcow2
   - Fixed in latest commit

2. **test.yml** (main workflow)
   - Problem: Was trying to download non-existent VM images
   - Fixed in latest commit

### ❓ Unknown Status

- test-docker.yml
- test-no-vm.yml
- test-reliable.yml
- test-simple.yml
- test-working.yml
- find-resources.yml

## Key Findings

1. **LVH doesn't provide pre-built VM images** - You must build them yourself
2. **Kernel pulls work** - But location where they're stored is unclear
3. **BPF compilation and verification work** - This is the most important part
4. **OCI images in docs may not exist** - Need to verify correct registry

## Recommendations

1. Use **test-clean.yml** as your main workflow - it tests what matters
2. Delete the experimental workflows once we confirm what works
3. For full VM testing, you'll need to build images locally first
