# Working eBPF Testing Setup

## What Works ✅

1. **eBPF Compilation** - Your minimal BPF programs compile successfully
2. **Basic Verification** - Can verify object file format and bytecode
3. **LVH Installation** - LVH installs and runs
4. **Kernel Downloads** - LVH can pull kernels (but storage location is unclear)

## What Doesn't Work ❌

1. **bpftool on Ubuntu 24.04** - Not available as a simple package
2. **VM Images** - LVH doesn't provide pre-built images in releases
3. **Full VM Testing in CI** - Requires building images locally first

## Working GitHub Actions Workflow

Use `test-final.yml` which:
- Compiles your eBPF programs
- Verifies the object files
- Tests across multiple kernel versions
- Provides instructions for local VM testing

## For Local Development

1. Install LVH:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/cilium/little-vm-helper/cmd/lvh@latest
   ```

2. Build a VM image:
   ```bash
   lvh images example-config > images.json
   # Edit images.json as needed
   lvh images build --dir .
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   lvh run --image _data/images/base.qcow2 --kernel <kernel> --host-mount .
   # Inside VM:
   cd /host && ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **For CI**: Use the compilation and verification tests
2. **For full testing**: Run VMs locally with built images
3. **For kernel compatibility**: Test compilation against different kernel headers
